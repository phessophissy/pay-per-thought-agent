    "answer": "Aave v3 on Ethereum mainnet currently has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $10.2 billion. This figure is verified by multiple independent sources including DeFiLlama and the official Aave protocol dashboard. Aave v3 maintains its position as the largest lending protocol on Ethereum. No current governance proposals are expected to materially impact TVL in the near term, with recent proposals (AIP-432, AIP-435) focused on collateral additions and risk parameter adjustments rather than structural changes.",
